	# library(chr/chr_debug)

Status
======

Work  in  progress.  The  compiler  source  (chr_translate.pl)  contains
various `todo' issues. The debugger is  almost non existent. Future work
should  improve  on   the   compatibility    with   the   reference  CHR
documentation. Details on loading CHR files are subject to change.
