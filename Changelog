	for +, - and ? as mode declarations.

Feb 25, 2005

  * TS: Fixed several bugs in generation of debugable code.

Feb 19, 2005

  * JW: Cleanup integration in SWI-Prolog environment:
	- Extended SWI-Prolog library ordsets.  Renamed ord_delete/3 to
	  ord_del_element/3 and ord_difference/3 to ord_subtract/3 for
	  better compatibility.
	- Renamed module find to chr_find to avoid name conflict and declared
	  preds as meta-predicate.
	- Re-inserted and exported strip_attributes/2 and
	  restore_attributes/2 in hprolog.pl. Deleted hprolog: from
	  chr_translate.chr.
	- Added dummy option declarations to bootstrap compiler.
	- Fixed path problems in makefile (-p chr=.) and install new
	  components.
	- Fixed typo 'chr show_store' --> chr_show_store.

  Summary of changes:

   "The new version of the compiler contains several new optimizations, both
    fully automatic, such as the antimonotny-based delay avoidance (see
    http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/publicaties/rapporten/cw/CW385.abs.html for
    the technical report), and enabled by mode declarations (see CHR
    documentation), such as hashtable-based constraint indexes."

Apr 9, 2004

  * JW: Added chr_messages.pl.  Make all debug messages use the print_message/2
    interface to enable future embedding.

Apr 7, 2004

  * JW: Added chr:debug_interact/3 hook.  Defined in chr_swi.pl to void
    showing constraints first as goal and then as CHR call.
  * JW: Added chr:debug_event/2 hook.  Defined in chr_swi.pl to make the
    CHR debugger honour a skip command from the Prolog tracer.

Apr 6, 2004

  * JW: Added b (break) to the CHR debugger.
  * TS: added chr_expandable/2 clause for pragma/2

Apr 5, 2004

  * JW: fixed reference to format_rule/2.
  * JW: Use select/3 rather than delete/3 in diff/2 in Tests/zebra.pl
  * TS: CHR translation now leaves CHR store empty

Apr 4, 2004

  * JW: added :- use_module(library(chr)) to all examples.
  * JW: mapped -O --> option(optimize, full).
  * JW: introduced file-search-path `chr' for clarity and to enable running
    make check from the local environment instead of the public installation.
  * JW: mapped prolog flag generate_debug_info --> option(debug, on)
  * JW: Replaced the chr -> pl step with term_expansion/2.
  * JW: Moved insert_declarations/2 to chr_swi.pl

Apr 2, 2004

  * TS: Added <space> for creep and shortened debug line prefix to CHR:

Mar 29, 2004

  * JW: Use \+ \+ in chr_compile/3 to undo changes to the constraint
    pool.  Regression test suite using "make check" works again.

Mar 25, 2004

  * TS: Added skip and ancestor debug commands

Mar 24, 2004

  * TS: Added bootstrapping process for CHR compiler using CHR.

  * TS: Exploit uniqueness (functional dependency) results to detect
    set semantics type simpagation rules where one rule can be passive
